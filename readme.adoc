= Allow-listing Source IPs to Pods on OpenShift IBM Cloud

== What's the issue?

By default, on IBM Cloud, when OpenShift is deployed in a VPC, all Routes will use a specially provided, Application Load Balancer (ALB) by default.
This is fine in most cases, but it has a specific drawback: as configured, it doesn't pass through the IP address of the requesting clientfootnote:[https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-lbaas[Exposing apps with load balancers for VPC]].
This makes it impossible to perform IP allow-listing via a NetworkPolicy.

    P -->|x|D(App Pod)
    P --> |http|E[️Drop]
```

== The Solution

In contrast to an ALB, a Network Load Balancer (NBL) does pass through the client's IP address.
There is a specific way to create an NBL from OpenShift, as a Service, which will be exposed directly via an assigned host name.
However, this lacks the built-in TLS handling that we would have gotten had we used a Route.
If your application Pods handle TLS natively this isn't an issue.
But that's not always the case, so we need another piece, a custom HTTP/S proxy to sit between the NLB and the application Pods, that will terminate the TLS and proxy traffic to the application's plain HTTP port.

    A[Browser] -->|https,1.2.3.4| B[NLB]
    B --> |https,1.2.3.4|C(NBL Service)
    C --> |https,1.2.3.4|D(HTTP Proxy Pod)
    D --> |http,1.2.3.4|P{NetworkPolicy: <br />Allow 1.2.3.4}
    P -->|http|E(App Pod)
    P --> |x|F[Drop]
```

== Getting Started

Log in to your OpenShift cluster and create a new namespace/project:

[source,bash]
oc new-project ip-allowlisting

Let's use "echo IP" as our sample app, so we can see the effects of the NLP in the application as well as the network policy.
We'll create a deployment, and expose it as a service internally within the cluster, but will stop short of exposing it publicly via a route.

[source,bash]
oc create deployment echo-ip --image=greenstatic/echo-ip
oc expose deployment echo-ip --port 8080
oc get services

=== (Optional Side Quest)

At this point we would normally expose the service as a route.
Feel free to do this now to check that your IP address really isn't being passed all the way to your pod.

[source,bash]
oc expose service echo-ip
curl http://echo-ip-ip-allowlisting.`oc get ingresses.config/cluster -o jsonpath={.spec.domain}`
curl http://ipv4.icanhazip.com

Compare the "remoteIP" value of the first curl to the output of the second.
If they're the same, congratulations the world has moved on and this tutorial is no longer necessary!
If they're not the same, then we're on the right track.
Let's clean up our test route and move on.

[source,bash]
oc delete route echo-ip

And now that we've proven the need for an NLP, let's create one.

=== Deploy a HTTP/S Proxy

At this point we need to a proxy that can sit between the NLP and the application Pods, performing TLS termination for us.
The nginx folder contains the proxy configuration that will terminate HTTPS traffic and proxy to our echo-ip service over regular HTTP.
The Dockerfile in this project brings it all together onto an nginx base image.
Below is a Docker command that will build and push the image to your Docker Hub account.

NOTE: Please be sure to replace <repository> below with your own repository.

[source,bash]
docker build --push --tag <repository>/http-proxy-echo-ip:latest .

If your docker hub repositories are set to private by default, now is a good time to either switch this image to public, or add a docker pull secret to the ip-allowlist project.

Now create the deployment for the HTTP proxy image.

[source,bash]
oc create deployment http-proxy-echo-ip --image=spruceki/http-proxy-echo-ip:latest

=== Create the NLP

CAUTION: This step will spin up an NLB in your IBM Cloud account, potentially incurring charges.

Now we create the NLP by applying a YAML fragment to our cluster.
This fragment was created using instructions from the IBM Kubernetes Guidefootnote:[https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-lbaas#setup_vpc_nlb[IBM Kubernetes Guide: Setting up a Network Load Balancer for VPC]]

[source,bash]
oc apply -f os-network-load-balancer.yaml
oc get services

You should see output similar to the following:

[source]
NAME      TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
vpc-nlb   LoadBalancer   172.21.129.113   <pending>     80:30103/TCP,443:30229/TCP   23s

Note the status of <pending>.
NLBs can take several minutes to provision, around 10 minutes in my experience.
The NLB will eventually be visible in your IBM Cloud account, under VPC Infrastructure > Load Balancers > 'openshift-vpc-nlb-ip-allowlisting'.
On that screen, find the hostname associated with the NLB and copy it to the clipboard.
Run the following command, replacing <nlbHostname> with the hostname you just copied.

[source,bash]
curl --inescure https://<nlbHostname>

NOTE: Note that the "ip" and "forwardedForIP in the response will be your public IP, and the "remoteIP" will still be an internal IP of the cluster.
As we'll demonstrate, this is enough to allow the NetworkPolicy allowlisting to work.

=== Apply the NetworkPolicy

In its current state, the network policy YAML fragment will allow traffic from within the cluster, and from the external IP address 1.2.3.4.
So if we apply it, we should find that we're no longer able to access the echo-ip service.

[source,bash]
oc apply -f os-http-proxy-network-policy.yaml
curl --inescure https://<nlbHostname> --connect-timeout 6

This should return a "Timeout was reached" error.
So far this only proves that the network policy has successfully blocked external traffic.
Let's see if we can let ourselves in again.
Update the os-http-proxy-network-policy.yaml file, replacing 1.2.3.4 with your public IP address.

[source,yaml]
    ...
    # public allowlistd IPs
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: <1.2.3.4>/32
    ...

Reapply the yaml NetWorkPolicy, refetch the URL and you should now have access:

[source,bash]
oc apply -f os-http-proxy-network-policy.yaml
curl --inescure https://<nlbHostname> --connect-timeout 6
